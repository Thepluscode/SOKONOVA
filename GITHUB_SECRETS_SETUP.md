railway login

# Link project
cd /Users/theophilusogieva/Downloads/sokonova-frontend/backend
railway link

# Get project info
railway status
```

### Step 5: Add Railway Secrets to GitHub

2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables**
3. Add these variables (for Production, Preview, and Development):

```env
# Backend API
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend.up.railway.app

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generate with: openssl rand -base64 32]
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app

# Sentry (Optional for now)

SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-sentry-auth-token
```

### Railway Environment Variables

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add these variables:

```env

## Part 4: Verify Setup

### Test 1: Check GitHub Secrets

2. You should see 5 secrets:
   - âœ… VERCEL_TOKEN
   - âœ… VERCEL_ORG_ID
   - âœ… VERCEL_PROJECT_ID
   - âœ… RAILWAY_TOKEN
   - âœ… RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID

### Test 2: Trigger Deployment

1. Make a small change to your code (e.g., update README.md)
2. Commit and push:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "test: trigger CI/CD"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Go to https://github.com/Thepluscode/SOKONOVA/actions
4. Watch the workflows run:
   - âœ… Frontend Deploy
   - âœ… Backend Deploy

### Test 3: Check Deployments

**Vercel:**
1. Go to https://vercel.com/[your-username]/sokonova
2. Check deployment status
3. Click on the deployment to see logs
4. Visit your live URL

**Railway:**
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click on your project
3. Check deployment logs
4. Visit your backend URL (Settings â†’ Domains)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Vercel deployment fails with "Project not found"
**Solution:** Double-check `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` matches your project ID in Vercel settings.

### Issue: Railway deployment fails with "Database connection error"
**Solution:**
1. Add PostgreSQL plugin in Railway dashboard
2. Copy the `DATABASE_URL` from Railway variables
3. Make sure `DATABASE_URL` is set in Railway environment variables

### Issue: GitHub Actions workflow doesn't trigger
**Solution:**
1. Check that secrets are added at repository level (not environment level)
2. Make sure branch name is `main` (not `master`)
3. Check workflow file is in `.github/workflows/` directory

### Issue: "Invalid token" error
**Solution:**
1. Regenerate the token (Vercel or Railway)
2. Update the GitHub secret with the new token
3. Re-run the workflow

## Next Steps After Setup

1. âœ… All secrets configured
2. âœ… First deployment successful
3. ðŸ”„ Run database seed:
   ```bash
   railway run npm run prisma:seed
   ```
4. ðŸ”„ Test your live app
5. ðŸ”„ Set up custom domain (optional)
6. ðŸ”„ Configure Sentry for monitoring
