# Fulfillment & Shipping Tracking System

## Overview

The Fulfillment & Shipping Tracking system transforms SokoNova from "we took your money" into **"your item is on the way, here's proof."** This builds buyer trust and reduces seller disputes through transparent shipping lifecycle management.

**Key Achievement:** Per-item fulfillment tracking that supports multi-seller orders, with complete shipping timelines visible to buyers and sellers.

---

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Per-Item Fulfillment Status**
- Each `OrderItem` tracks its own shipping status
- Status flow: PACKED â†’ SHIPPED â†’ DELIVERED (or ISSUE)
- Supports multi-seller orders where different items ship separately
- Timestamped transitions (shippedAt, deliveredAt)

### 2. **Seller Fulfillment Dashboard**
- View all items awaiting shipment
- Mark items as shipped with tracking info
- Mark items as delivered with proof
- See buyer shipping address and contact info
- Flag issues for admin attention

### 3. **Buyer Order Tracking**
- Visual shipping timeline per item
- Real-time status updates
- Tracking codes with carrier information
- Delivery proof viewing
- Issue notifications

### 4. **Proof of Delivery**
- Sellers can attach delivery proof URLs (photos, signatures, receipts)
- Reduces disputes and chargebacks
- Creates audit trail for marketplace protection

## Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions

**OrderItem Model** (Extended):
```prisma
model OrderItem {
  // ... existing fields ...

  // --- FULFILLMENT & SHIPPING TRACKING ---
  fulfillmentStatus FulfillmentStatus @default(PACKED)
  shippedAt         DateTime?
  deliveredAt       DateTime?
  trackingCode      String?       // Tracking number from carrier
  carrier           String?       // DHL, FedEx, UPS, local courier
  deliveryProofUrl  String?       // Photo of package, signature, receipt
  notes             String?       // Seller note to buyer
}

enum FulfillmentStatus {
  PACKED      // Seller prepared item, ready to ship
  SHIPPED     // Handed off to carrier with tracking
  DELIVERED   // Buyer received / confirmed delivery
  ISSUE       // Dispute, lost, damaged, or other problem
}
```

### Backend Modules

```

â””â”€â”€ dto/
    â””â”€â”€ fulfillment.dto.ts      # Validation DTOs
```

### Frontend Pages & Components

```

â”œâ”€â”€ seller/seller-inner.tsx     # Shipments section added
â””â”€â”€ orders/[orderId]/tracking/  # Buyer tracking page
    â””â”€â”€ page.tsx

## How It Works

### Order Creation Flow

When a buyer places an order:

1. **Order is created** with status `PENDING`
2. **Payment is processed** â†’ Order status becomes `PAID`
3. **OrderItems are created** with:
   - Initial `fulfillmentStatus`: `PACKED`
   - Seller ID for ownership
   - All other fields null (awaiting seller action)

### Seller Fulfillment Workflow

1. **Seller views fulfillment queue** at `/seller`
   - Sees all PACKED and SHIPPED items
   - Sees buyer shipping address and contact info

2. **Seller prepares and ships item**
   - Enters carrier name (e.g., "DHL", "FedEx")
   - Enters tracking code
   - Adds optional note to buyer
   - Clicks "Confirm Shipped"

3. **Backend updates item**
   - `fulfillmentStatus`: PACKED â†’ SHIPPED
   - `shippedAt`: Current timestamp
   - `carrier`, `trackingCode`, `notes` saved

4. **Seller confirms delivery**
   - When item is delivered, enters proof URL
   - Adds delivery note (e.g., "Left with security")
   - Clicks "Confirm Delivered"

5. **Backend finalizes item**
   - `fulfillmentStatus`: SHIPPED â†’ DELIVERED
   - `deliveredAt`: Current timestamp
   - `deliveryProofUrl`, `notes` saved

### Buyer Tracking Experience

1. **Buyer visits** `/orders/{orderId}/tracking`
2. **Sees visual timeline** for each item:
   - âœ… Order Placed (timestamp)
   - âœ… Shipped (timestamp, tracking code, carrier)
   - âœ… Delivered (timestamp, proof link)

3. **If item has tracking code:**
   - Displayed prominently with carrier name
   - Can copy/paste into carrier website

4. **If item has delivery proof:**
   - Link to view photo/receipt
   - Builds trust and reduces disputes

### Multi-Seller Orders

If an order contains products from multiple sellers:
- Each item tracks fulfillment independently
- Items can be at different statuses
- Buyer sees all items on one tracking page
- Each seller only sees/manages their own items

**Example:**
```
Order #123:
â”œâ”€ Item A (Seller 1): DELIVERED âœ…
â”œâ”€ Item B (Seller 1): DELIVERED âœ…
â”œâ”€ Item C (Seller 2): SHIPPED ðŸšš
â””â”€ Item D (Seller 3): PACKED ðŸ“¦
```

## Testing the System

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_fulfillment_tracking
```

### 2. Test Seller Flow

```bash
# Get seller's open fulfillment queue
curl "http://localhost:4000/fulfillment/seller/open?sellerId=SELLER_ID"

# Mark item as shipped
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:4000/fulfillment/seller/ship/ITEM_ID?sellerId=SELLER_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "carrier": "DHL",
    "trackingCode": "1234567890",
    "note": "Expected delivery in 2-3 days"
  }'

# Mark item as delivered
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:4000/fulfillment/seller/deliver/ITEM_ID?sellerId=SELLER_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "proofUrl": "https://example.com/proof.jpg",
    "note": "Left with security guard"
  }'
```

### 3. Test Buyer Flow

```bash
# Get order tracking
curl "http://localhost:4000/fulfillment/tracking/ORDER_ID?userId=BUYER_ID"
```

### 4. UI Testing

1. **Seller Dashboard:**
   - Login as seller
   - Go to `/seller`

   - Test marking items as shipped/delivered

2. **Buyer Tracking:**
   - Login as buyer
   - Go to `/orders/{orderId}/tracking`
   - View shipping timeline
   - Check tracking codes display

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Carrier Integration**

Automate tracking updates via carrier APIs:

**DHL API:**
```typescript
async function updateTrackingFromDHL(trackingCode: string) {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.dhl.com/track/shipments?trackingNumber=${trackingCode}`, {
    headers: { 'DHL-API-Key': process.env.DHL_API_KEY },
  });

  const data = await response.json();

  if (data.shipments[0].status.statusCode === 'delivered') {
    await markDelivered(orderItemId, sellerId, data.shipments[0].details.proofOfDeliveryUrl);
  }
}
```

### 2. **Smart Tracking Page**

- Live carrier tracking widget embedded
- Estimated delivery date prediction
- Delivery time slot selection
- Delivery location map

### 3. **Proof of Delivery Image Upload**

Instead of URL input, allow sellers to upload directly:

```typescript
// Backend: Add upload endpoint
@Post('upload-proof')
@UseInterceptors(FileInterceptor('file'))
async uploadProof(@UploadedFile() file: Express.Multer.File) {
  const url = await this.cloudinary.upload(file);
  return { url };
}
```

```typescript
// Frontend: File upload in seller dashboard
<input
  type="file"
  accept="image/*"
  onChange={async (e) => {
    const file = e.target.files?.[0];
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', file);

    const { url } = await uploadProof(formData);
    setProof(url);
  }}
/>
```

### 4. **QR Code for Delivery Confirmation**

Generate QR code for each order item. Buyer scans on delivery:

```typescript
// Generate QR code
const qrCode = generateQRCode({
  orderItemId: item.id,
  confirmationToken: crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex'),
});

// Buyer scans QR â†’ Auto-confirms delivery
```

### 5. **Returns & Exchanges**

Extend fulfillment to handle reverse logistics:

```prisma
enum FulfillmentStatus {
  // ... existing statuses ...
  RETURN_REQUESTED
  RETURN_SHIPPED
  RETURN_RECEIVED
  EXCHANGED
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Fulfillment queue empty but items exist

**Cause:** Items already marked as DELIVERED

**Solution:** Check fulfillment stats endpoint:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:4000/fulfillment/seller/stats?sellerId=SELLER_ID"
```

### Issue: Tracking page shows "Order Not Found"

**Cause:** Either order doesn't exist or buyer doesn't own it

**Solution:**
1. Verify order ID is correct
2. Verify user is logged in
3. Check order belongs to logged-in user

### Issue: Can't mark item as shipped

**Cause:** Seller doesn't own the item

**Solution:** Verify `sellerId` matches the product's seller

### Issue: Tracking code not clickable

**Cause:** Just text display, not auto-linked

**Solution:** Add carrier-specific tracking URL generation:
```typescript
function getTrackingUrl(carrier: string, code: string) {
  const carriers = {
    'DHL': `https://www.dhl.com/tracking?id=${code}`,
    'FedEx': `https://www.fedex.com/fedextrack/?trknbr=${code}`,
    'UPS': `https://www.ups.com/track?tracknum=${code}`,
  };
  return carriers[carrier] || '#';
}
```
