## How It Works

### Notification Flow with Preferences

```
1. Event Triggered (e.g., payment success)
   ‚Üì
2. NotificationsService.create() called with channels: ['inapp', 'email', 'sms']
   ‚Üì
3. Service fetches user preferences from database
   ‚Üì
4. Checks user's notification settings:
   - Is email enabled? (notifyEmail = true?)
   - Is SMS enabled? (notifySms = true?)
   - Is phone number present?
   ‚Üì
5. Checks quiet hours:
   - Get current hour in user's timezone
   - Compare with quietHoursStart and quietHoursEnd
   - Skip email/SMS if in quiet hours
   ‚Üì
6. Send via enabled channels:
   - In-app: Always saved to database
   - Email: SendGrid if enabled and not in quiet hours
   - SMS: Africa's Talking if enabled and not in quiet hours
   ‚Üì
7. Log results (success or failure)
```

### Quiet Hours Example

**User Settings:**
- Timezone: Africa/Lagos (WAT)
- Quiet Hours: 22:00 - 08:00

**Scenario 1:** Notification at 23:30 Lagos time
- ‚úÖ In-app notification saved
- ‚ùå Email skipped (quiet hours)
- ‚ùå SMS skipped (quiet hours)

**Scenario 2:** Notification at 10:00 Lagos time
- ‚úÖ In-app notification saved
- ‚úÖ Email sent (outside quiet hours)
- ‚úÖ SMS sent (outside quiet hours)
