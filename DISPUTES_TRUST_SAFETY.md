# Trust & Safety / Dispute Center System

## Overview

The Trust & Safety / Dispute Center system protects the marketplace from chargebacks and fraud while providing buyers and sellers with a structured resolution process for order issues.

**Key Achievement:** Transform after-sale support from "he-said-she-said chaos" into **structured, auditable dispute resolution** that reduces chargebacks and builds platform trust.

---

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Per-Item Dispute Tracking**
- Disputes attached to individual `OrderItem` (not whole orders)
- Supports multi-seller orders where only one item has issues
- Five dispute reasons: NOT_DELIVERED, DAMAGED, COUNTERFEIT, WRONG_ITEM, OTHER
- Photo proof upload for evidence

### 2. **Buyer Issue Reporting**
- "Report a problem" button on order tracking page
- Inline form with reason selection and description
- Optional photo proof URL
- Automatic flagging: sets `fulfillmentStatus` to ISSUE

### 3. **Seller Issue Queue**
- Dedicated "Issues & Disputes" section in seller dashboard
- See all OPEN and SELLER_RESPONDED disputes
- Complete context: buyer details, order info, proof
- Three resolution actions: Send Replacement, Refund Buyer, Reject Claim

### 4. **Automatic Status Management**
- Opening dispute → `fulfillmentStatus` = ISSUE
- Resolution updates both `Dispute.status` AND `OrderItem.fulfillmentStatus`
- Complete audit trail with timestamps and actor tracking

### 5. **Payout Protection**
- Items marked ISSUE can be excluded from payouts
- Platform can withhold payment until dispute resolved
- Reduces financial risk from fraudulent claims

---

## Architecture

### Database Schema

**Dispute Model**:
```prisma
model Dispute {
  id              String         @id @default(cuid())
  orderItem       OrderItem      @relation(fields: [orderItemId], references: [id])
  orderItemId     String
  buyer           User           @relation(fields: [buyerId], references: [id])
  buyerId         String

  reasonCode      DisputeReason  // e.g. DAMAGED / NOT_DELIVERED / COUNTERFEIT / OTHER
  description     String         // buyer's description
  photoProofUrl   String?        // optional photo/video link from buyer

  status          DisputeStatus  @default(OPEN)
  resolutionNote  String?
  resolvedById    String?        // admin or seller who closed it
  resolvedAt      DateTime?

  createdAt       DateTime       @default(now())
  updatedAt       DateTime       @updatedAt
}

enum DisputeReason {
  NOT_DELIVERED
  DAMAGED
  COUNTERFEIT
  WRONG_ITEM
  OTHER
}

enum DisputeStatus {
  OPEN
  SELLER_RESPONDED
  RESOLVED_BUYER_COMPENSATED
  RESOLVED_REDELIVERED
  REJECTED
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Disputes link to `OrderItem` for granular tracking
- `photoProofUrl` provides evidence for fraud prevention
- `resolvedById` creates accountability (who resolved it)
- `status` tracks resolution workflow

## API Endpoints

### Buyer Endpoints

#### Open Dispute
```http
POST /disputes/open
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "buyerId": "user_123",
  "orderItemId": "oi_456",
  "reasonCode": "NOT_DELIVERED",
  "description": "Package never arrived. Tracking shows delivered but I didn't receive it.",
  "photoProofUrl": "https://example.com/empty-mailbox.jpg"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "dispute_789",
  "orderItemId": "oi_456",
  "buyerId": "user_123",
  "reasonCode": "NOT_DELIVERED",
  "description": "Package never arrived...",
  "photoProofUrl": "https://example.com/empty-mailbox.jpg",
  "status": "OPEN",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-28T10:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Side Effects:**
- Creates `Dispute` record
- Updates `OrderItem.fulfillmentStatus` to `ISSUE`
- Prevents duplicate disputes (checks for existing OPEN/SELLER_RESPONDED)

#### List My Disputes
```http
GET /disputes/mine?buyerId=user_123
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "dispute_789",
    "reasonCode": "NOT_DELIVERED",
    "description": "Package never arrived...",
    "status": "OPEN",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-28T10:00:00.000Z",
    "orderItem": {
      "product": {
        "title": "Handmade Bag",
        "imageUrl": "https://...",
        "sellerId": "seller_abc"
      },
      "order": {
        "id": "order_123",
        "createdAt": "2025-10-25T14:00:00.000Z"
      }
    }
  }
]
```

### Seller/Admin Endpoints

#### Get Seller's Issue Queue
```http
GET /disputes/seller?sellerId=seller_abc
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "dispute_789",
    "orderItemId": "oi_456",
    "buyerId": "user_123",
    "reasonCode": "NOT_DELIVERED",
    "description": "Package never arrived...",
    "photoProofUrl": "https://example.com/empty-mailbox.jpg",
    "status": "OPEN",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-28T10:00:00.000Z",
    "orderItem": {
      "product": {
        "title": "Handmade Bag",
        "imageUrl": "https://..."
      },
      "order": {
        "id": "order_123",
        "userId": "user_123",
        "createdAt": "2025-10-25T14:00:00.000Z"
      }
    },
    "buyer": {
      "id": "user_123",
      "email": "buyer@example.com",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  }
]
```

#### Resolve Dispute
```http
PATCH /disputes/dispute_789/resolve
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "actorId": "seller_abc",
  "status": "RESOLVED_REDELIVERED",
  "resolutionNote": "Reshipped with expedited delivery. New tracking: DHL-9876543210"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "dispute_789",
  "status": "RESOLVED_REDELIVERED",
  "resolutionNote": "Reshipped with expedited delivery...",
  "resolvedById": "seller_abc",
  "resolvedAt": "2025-10-28T15:30:00.000Z",
  ...
}
```

**Side Effects (depends on resolution status):**
- `RESOLVED_REDELIVERED` → `fulfillmentStatus` = DELIVERED
- `RESOLVED_BUYER_COMPENSATED` → `fulfillmentStatus` = ISSUE (stays)
- `REJECTED` → `fulfillmentStatus` = DELIVERED
- `SELLER_RESPONDED` → No change to fulfillmentStatus

---

## How It Works

### Buyer Flow: Opening a Dispute

1. **Buyer visits order tracking** at `/orders/{orderId}/tracking`
2. **Sees "Report a problem" button** for shipped items
3. **Clicks button** → Inline form appears
4. **Selects reason** (Never arrived, Damaged, Counterfeit, etc.)
5. **Writes description** of the issue
6. **Optionally adds photo proof** URL
7. **Clicks "Submit"**

**Backend Processing:**
```typescript
// 1. Verify buyer owns the order item
const oi = await prisma.orderItem.findUnique({
  where: { id: orderItemId },
  include: { order: true },
});

if (oi.order.userId !== buyerId) {
  throw new ForbiddenException('You do not own this item');
}

// 2. Check for duplicate disputes
const existingOpen = await prisma.dispute.findFirst({
  where: {
    orderItemId,
    status: { in: ['OPEN', 'SELLER_RESPONDED'] },
  },
});

if (existingOpen) {
  throw new BadRequestException('Dispute already open for this item');
}

// 3. Create dispute
const dispute = await prisma.dispute.create({
  data: {
    orderItemId,
    buyerId,
    reasonCode,
    description,
    photoProofUrl,
    status: 'OPEN',
  },
});

// 4. Flag order item as ISSUE
await prisma.orderItem.update({
  where: { id: orderItemId },
  data: { fulfillmentStatus: 'ISSUE' },
});
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Dispute created with status OPEN
- ✅ OrderItem marked as ISSUE
- ✅ Appears in seller's issue queue
- ✅ Buyer sees confirmation message

### Seller Flow: Resolving a Dispute

1. **Seller logs into dashboard** at `/seller`
2. **Scrolls to "Issues & Disputes" section**
3. **Sees dispute card** with:
   - Product title
   - Buyer's complaint and reason
   - Photo proof (if provided)
   - Order details and buyer contact
4. **Reads the issue** and investigates
5. **Enters resolution note** in textarea
6. **Chooses action:**
   - **Send Replacement** → Reship item to buyer
   - **Refund Buyer** → Issue refund, eat the loss
   - **Reject Claim** → Dispute invalid, seller wins

**Backend Processing:**
```typescript
// 1. Verify actor is seller or admin
const actor = await prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: actorId } });
const isAdmin = actor.role === 'ADMIN';
const isSellerOwner = actor.id === dispute.orderItem.sellerId;

if (!isAdmin && !isSellerOwner) {
  throw new ForbiddenException('Not allowed to resolve this dispute');
}

// 2. Update dispute
const updatedDispute = await prisma.dispute.update({
  where: { id: disputeId },
  data: {
    status,
    resolutionNote,
    resolvedById: actorId,
    resolvedAt: new Date(),
  },
});

// 3. Update fulfillment status based on resolution
if (status === 'RESOLVED_REDELIVERED') {
  // Re-sent good item → mark DELIVERED
  await prisma.orderItem.update({
    where: { id: dispute.orderItemId },
    data: { fulfillmentStatus: 'DELIVERED' },
  });
} else if (status === 'RESOLVED_BUYER_COMPENSATED') {
  // Refunded → keep as ISSUE (we ate the loss)
  // fulfillmentStatus stays ISSUE
} else if (status === 'REJECTED') {
  // Seller wins → restore to DELIVERED
  await prisma.orderItem.update({
    where: { id: dispute.orderItemId },
    data: { fulfillmentStatus: 'DELIVERED' },
  });
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Dispute status updated
- ✅ Resolution note saved
- ✅ Actor and timestamp recorded
- ✅ FulfillmentStatus updated appropriately
- ✅ Dispute removed from seller's queue

---

## Business Rules

### When to Block Payouts

**Recommended Policy:**
```typescript
// Don't pay sellers for items with unresolved disputes
const itemsEligibleForPayout = await prisma.orderItem.findMany({
  where: {
    sellerId,
    payoutStatus: 'PENDING',
    fulfillmentStatus: { not: 'ISSUE' }, // ← Key filter
  },
});
```

**Options:**
1. **Conservative:** Block payout until dispute resolved
2. **Balanced:** Block for 14 days, then pay if no resolution
3. **Aggressive:** Pay immediately, claw back if refunded

### Chargeback Protection

When buyer files chargeback with bank:
1. Find associated dispute (if any)
2. Export dispute evidence:
   - Buyer's description
   - Photo proof
   - Seller's resolution note
   - Delivery proof from fulfillment
3. Submit to payment processor as defense
4. This evidence often wins disputes

### Seller Performance

Track dispute rate per seller:
```typescript
const disputes = await prisma.dispute.count({
  where: {
    orderItem: { sellerId },
    createdAt: { gte: thirtyDaysAgo },
  },
});

const orders = await prisma.orderItem.count({
  where: {
    sellerId,
    createdAt: { gte: thirtyDaysAgo },
  },
});

const disputeRate = (disputes / orders) * 100;

if (disputeRate > 5) {
  // Warning threshold
} else if (disputeRate > 10) {
  // Suspend seller
}
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. **Returns & Exchanges**

Extend disputes to handle returns:
```prisma
enum DisputeReason {
  // ... existing reasons
  RETURN_REQUESTED
  EXCHANGE_REQUESTED
}

model Dispute {
  // ... existing fields
  returnTrackingCode String?
  refundAmount       Decimal?
}
```

### 2. **Mediation System**

Three-way conversations:
- Buyer explains issue
- Seller responds
- Admin mediates if stuck

### 3. **Automated Resolution**

AI-powered suggestions:
- Analyze description
- Suggest resolution (refund/reship/reject)
- Auto-approve low-risk cases

### 4. **Dispute Prevention**

Proactive alerts:
- "Tracking shows delivered 3 days ago, confirm receipt?"
- "Item marked damaged, contact seller?"
- Reduces disputes before they start

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't open dispute (400 Bad Request)

**Cause:** Duplicate dispute already exists

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check for existing disputes
curl "http://localhost:4000/disputes/mine?buyerId=BUYER_ID"

# If found, work with existing dispute
```

### Issue: Seller can't resolve dispute (403 Forbidden)

**Cause:** Seller doesn't own the item

**Solution:** Verify `orderItem.sellerId` matches `seller.id`

### Issue: FulfillmentStatus not updating after resolution

**Cause:** Resolution status doesn't trigger update

**Check:** Only these statuses update fulfillment:
- `RESOLVED_REDELIVERED` → DELIVERED
- `RESOLVED_BUYER_COMPENSATED` → ISSUE (stays)
- `REJECTED` → DELIVERED
- `SELLER_RESPONDED` → No change

### Issue: Dispute button not showing on tracking page

**Causes:**
1. Item not shipped yet (no `shippedAt`)
2. Already marked as ISSUE
3. DisputeButtonClient not imported

**Solution:** Check item status and imports
